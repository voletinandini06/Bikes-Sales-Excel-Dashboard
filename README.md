# Bikes-Sales-Excel-Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bike sales data to uncover key insights into customer demographics, preferences, and sales trends. Using Excel for data visualization and analysis, I developed an interactive dashboard that highlights patterns across various dimensions, such as marital status, region, education level, and commuting habits. The findings provide actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and improve sales performance.

## Data Sources

Bike Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis contains detailed information about bike purchases, including customer demographics, commuting patterns, and purchasing preferences.

## Data Preparation

Analyzed customer demographics (e.g., marital status, education) to identify purchase patterns.
Explored the relationship between commuting distance and bike purchases.
Investigated the impact of income, age, and region on purchasing behavior.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Key questions explored during the analysis:

What are the trends in bike purchases across regions and education levels?
How does income influence bike purchases?
Which age groups are more likely to purchase bikes?
What is the correlation between commute distance and bike purchases?

## Results/Findings

This project demonstrates effective data analysis using Excel, transforming raw data into an actionable dashboard. Key insights include:

Income Trends: Higher-income customers are more likely to purchase bikes.
Age Group Preferences: Middle-aged customers represent the largest segment of bike buyers.
Regional Sales: Significant differences in purchasing behavior across regions.
Commute Impact: Customers with shorter commute distances are more inclined to purchase bikes.
Recommendations
Develop targeted marketing campaigns for middle-aged customers in high-purchase regions.
Focus promotions on high-income customer segments.
Design bikes and accessories tailored to commuters with shorter distances.
